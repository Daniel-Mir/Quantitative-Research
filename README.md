# Quantitative-Projects
I'm a Mathematics student studying at Bristol University and currently doing a year abroad at the University of Melbourne who is interested in getting into the the world of Quantitative Finance! I have much more experience in the Quantitative side (i.e. maths and statistics) and am using this space as an opportunity to learn more about finance and also to practice my programming / data science skills.
